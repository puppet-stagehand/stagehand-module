# patchbot_refresh — the Windows patch scanner behind the patchbot fact
# (formerly pcm_patch_refresh / pcm_patch).
#
# Run from a scheduled task created by `stagehand::patching` (default: daily
# with jitter, plus at boot). Writes
# C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\patchbot\patch_cache.json, which patchbot.ps1
# reads cheaply on every Facter run.
#
# The split matters: a Windows Update Agent search reaches WSUS or Windows
# Update and routinely takes minutes. Doing that inside a fact would stall
# every Puppet run on the box. Scanner writes, fact reads — the same shape
# pe_patch uses.
#
# Deliberate choices, each of which is a bug in something else:
#
#   * Get-HotFix / Win32_QuickFixEngineering are NOT used. Both read only the
#     CBS/QFE store and miss a large fraction of installed updates — every LCU
#     delivered through Windows Update, servicing stack updates, .NET Framework
#     updates, Defender definitions. Tools built on Get-HotFix under-report
#     installed patches and therefore over-report vulnerabilities.
#
#   * Installed state comes from BOTH IUpdateSearcher.QueryHistory (filtered to
#     ResultCode 2 = succeeded) and Search("IsInstalled=1"). History catches
#     updates the current service no longer offers; the search catches updates
#     applied before this history began (image-baked, or history rolled).
#
#   * CveIDs is read off IUpdate2 and the result is reported as a diagnostic
#     rather than assumed. See cve_ids_populated below.
#
# Exit code is always 0: a scheduled task that "fails" produces alerts nobody
# actions. Scan failures are recorded in the cache as scan_error and surfaced
# through the fact, where the console's coverage view can show them honestly.
