# tools/supplychain/scan.sh — static pattern checks for Puppet DSL / Ruby
# content that no off-the-shelf scanner covers: unpinned remote-fetch-into-
# shell execs, undocumented base64 blobs, and obfuscated/dynamically-eval'd
# Ruby in this module's custom types/providers/functions/tasks.
#
# Modeled on puppet-console's Go supply-chain gate (tools/supplychain,
# SC-INST-001/SC-INST-002, docs/SUPPLY-CHAIN.md's "no install-time
# execution" control) but is its own small, dependency-free tool for this
# repo's language (Puppet DSL + Ruby, not Go) -- it shares that gate's
# philosophy (rule ID + threat + remedy, scoped/dated/owned waivers that
# expire rather than a blanket disable, fail closed) but not its code.
#
# Usage: tools/supplychain/scan.sh [-waivers PATH]
# Exit codes: 0 clean (or every finding waived), 1 one or more live
# findings, 2 tool/config error (not a git repo, malformed waiver file).
#
# Scope: every file `git ls-files` tracks (so build output / .gitignore'd
# fixtures are never scanned, and a checkout outside a worktree fails
# loudly rather than silently scanning nothing).

# is a filesystem path/URL, not encoded content -- real base64 output
# distributes `/` far more sparsely (~1 in 64 chars) than a path does.
